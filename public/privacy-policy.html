        <p>Your privacy is fundamental to Laters.life. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and protect it, and the limited circumstances under which it might be shared. Our goal is transparency and providing you control over your information.</p>
        <div class="privacy-commitment">
            <strong>Our Core Privacy Principles:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> We build Laters.life with your privacy as a primary consideration.</li>
                <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You control who sees the content you share within the App's features.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We strive to collect only the information necessary to operate, secure, and improve Laters.life.</li>
                <li><strong>No Selling of Data:</strong> We do not sell your personal information or your User Content. Ever.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Sharing:</strong> We do not share your personal data or content with third parties for their own marketing purposes. Sharing is limited to essential operational needs or legal requirements, as detailed below.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>By using Laters.life, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>To provide and improve Laters.life, we collect the following types of information:</p>

        <h3>2.1. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect information such as your chosen username, email address, and potentially a password (or authentication token). This is used for account creation, login, security, and essential communications.</li>
            <li><strong>User Content:</strong> This includes the videos, photos, associated titles, descriptions, or any other media or text you upload, create, or share through Laters.life ("User Content"). This content is stored securely and is only accessible as dictated by your sharing settings within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us directly (e.g., for customer support), we may receive additional information about you, such as your name, email address, the contents of your message, and any attachments you provide.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with Laters.life. This may include features you use, actions you take (like sharing or viewing content), timestamps of activity, and general usage patterns. This helps us understand how the App is used, identify popular features, troubleshoot issues, and improve the service.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect information about the device you use to access Laters.life, such as the device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (like Android ID or Advertising ID, used primarily for non-personalized functions like crash analysis or subscription management), IP address, and mobile network information. This is used for optimizing app performance, security analysis, providing customer support, and managing subscriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports and Diagnostics:</strong> If the App crashes or encounters errors, we may automatically collect diagnostic information, including device information, app state at the time of the crash, and potentially parts of log files, to help us identify and fix bugs.</li>
        </ul>

         <h3>2.3. Information Related to Subscriptions & Purchases</h3>
         <ul>
             <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> If you subscribe to premium features, we need to know your current subscription status (e.g., active, expired, trial period) and entitlement level to grant you access to those features. This information is managed via Google Play's Billing system, Apple's billing system,  and potentially other 3rd party payment services.</li>
             <li><strong>Transaction Information :</strong> While we know *that* a purchase occurred and the subscription details (product ID, duration, status), we do **not** directly collect or store your sensitive payment information like credit card numbers. All payment processing is handled securely by Google Play and Apple. You should review Google's and Apple's privacy policies regarding payment information.</li>
             <li><strong>Purchase History (within Laters.life context):</strong> We maintain a record of the subscriptions associated with your account for management and support purposes.</li>
         </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes, always grounded in our commitment to privacy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> Operate the core functionalities of Laters.life, including account management, storing, processing, and delivering your User Content according to your explicit sharing instructions within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>To Manage Subscriptions:</strong> Process your subscription choices, grant access to premium features, and manage billing cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve and Personalize the App:</strong> Understand usage patterns, diagnose technical problems, fix bugs, develop new features, and improve the overall user experience. Personalization is generally limited to the functioning of the app based on your interactions, not for external advertising.</li>
            <li><strong>To Communicate With You:</strong> Send essential service-related announcements (e.g., maintenance, security updates, changes to terms or policies), respond to your support requests, and potentially inform you about new features or offers related *only* to Laters.life (you may have options to control non-essential communications).</li>
            <li><strong>For Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> Monitor for suspicious activity, protect against spam, abuse, and unauthorized access, enforce our Terms of Service, and ensure the security and integrity of Laters.life.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Compliance:</strong> Comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. How Information Is Shared</h2>
        <p>Your privacy and the confidentiality of your User Content are paramount. We do not sell your data. We share information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Other Laters.life Users (As Directed by You):</strong> The core function of Laters.life is private sharing. Your User Content is shared *only* with the specific Laters.life users you choose to share it with through the App's features. You control this sharing.</li>
            <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We work with trusted third-party companies to help us operate, provide, improve, secure, and market (only for Laters.life itself) our Services. These providers perform services on our behalf and have access to your information only as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks, and they are obligated contractually not to disclose or use it for other purposes. Examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Hosting Providers:</strong> To store your User Content and application data securely (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Processors / Subscription Management:</strong> Google Play manages payments. We use Google Play Billing, Apple Billing,  and may use RevenueCat (<a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a>) to manage subscription status and entitlements across platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> For aggregated, often anonymized, usage data to understand app performance and identify areas for improvement (e.g., Firebase Analytics for crash reporting).</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Support Platforms:</strong> If we use a third-party tool to manage support communications.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request (e.g., a subpoena or court order); (b) enforce our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, or safety of Laters.life, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
            <li><strong>In Case of Business Transfer:</strong> If Laters.life is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of its assets, financing, or similar transaction or proceeding, your information may be shared or transferred as part of that transaction, subject to standard confidentiality agreements and provided the successor entity upholds the commitments made in this Privacy Policy or provides notice of changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We reiterate: We do not sell your personal information or User Content to third parties. We do not share your User Content outside of the explicit sharing you initiate within Laters.life or the necessary technical processing by our hosting providers, unless legally compelled.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Your Choices and Control</h2>
        <p>We believe you should have control over your information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessing and Updating Information:</strong> You can update your account information (like email or username) directly within the App's settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Sharing Controls:</strong> The core of Laters.life is your control over who sees your User Content. Utilize the sharing settings within the App to manage access.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Deletion:</strong> You can delete specific pieces of User Content you have uploaded through the App's interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can request the deletion of your Laters.life account, usually through the App settings or by contacting support. Deleting your account will typically remove your profile and associated User Content from our active servers, subject to our data retention policies (see below).</li>
            <li><strong>Managing Communications:</strong> We may provide options within the App or via email links to manage preferences for non-essential communications from us.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

     <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your data seriously and implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include encryption (where appropriate), access controls, and secure development practices. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your information for as long as is necessary to provide the Laters.life service to you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements, and maintaining security. Account information and User Content are generally retained while your account is active. When you delete your account, we initiate a process to delete your information from our active systems. Please note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There may be latency in deleting information from our servers and backup storage.</li>
            <li>We may retain certain information if necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention, security, or if required by law (e.g., for legal holds, tax, or accounting purposes).</li>
            <li>Aggregated or anonymized data, which cannot reasonably identify you, may be retained indefinitely for analytics and service improvement.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
